## Installation

At the very basic level, installing Amar Web UI library can be done by using package managers such as yarn and npm.

```shell
# Using npm
npm install @amar-web-ui/core

# Using yarn
yarn add @amar-web-ui/core
```

Installing `@amar-web-ui/core` will also expose all the underlying packages which you can consume safely into
the project. Find out more about it below.
