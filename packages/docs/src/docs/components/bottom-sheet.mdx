A **bottom sheet** is simply an interuptive component that demands user's attention and
input to dismiss, similar to a dialog. It is typically used when we want to divert user's attention
on an important information that we want the user to know. Like dialogs and modals, it's required
to present a bottom sheet with a call-to-action element like a button or link for next action.

## Implementation

To implement a bottom sheet, first create a bottom sheet wrapper by appending `BottomSheet` class.
Then add `BottomSheet-dialog` and `BottomSheet-backdrop` as direct children.

- `BottomSheet` transforms an element into a bottom sheet wrapper. Controls how it position itself in relative
  to the viewport since it is fixed at the bottom.
- `BottomSheet-dialog` is where you can put any content inside.
- `BottomSheet-backdrop` creates a semi-transparent overlay that cover every view behind the backdrop and
  normally acts as the click target to dismiss the bottom sheet.

Here are some of the classes you can use inside of `BottomSheet-dialog`.

- `BottomSheet-header` is typically used to present the title and description of the bottom sheet.
- `BottomSheet-body` is where you should put all vital information that you want to present.
- `BottomSheet-footer` is where you could normally put the call-to-action such as buttons or links.
- `BottomSheet-media` is an **optional** part element where you can put illustrative media for visual aids.

Since the example below is just for illustrative purposes, both `BottomSheet` and `BottomSheet-backdrop`
classes are omitted.

```html preview=true bgColor=lighter center=true
<div class="BottomSheet-dialog">
  <div class="BottomSheet-block PaddingTop-xlarge PaddingBottom-xlarge">
    <div class="Flex JustifyContent-center">
      <img

        style="width: 30%"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="BottomSheet-block">
    <h5 class="Typography-heading20 MarginBottom-2xsmall">Selamat, Pinjaman Anda telah lunas!</h5>
    <p class="Color-neutral-80 MarginBottom">
      Terima kasih telah menggunakan pinjaman Tunaiku. Surat keterangan lunas akan dikirim ke alamat
      Anda.
    </p>
    <button class="Button Button--fullWidth Button--success">Ajukan Pinjaman Lagi</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Live Example

Here's a rough visualization of how a bottom sheet would look in a real-app view (see it in **Mobile View**
for the best experience).
