## Breakpoints

```scss
// Small (sm) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 576px) {
  /* ... */
}

// Medium (md) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* ... */
}

// Large (lg) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* ... */
}

// Extra large (xl) breakpoint.
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  /* ... */
}
```

#### Responsive media

- You can set up properties that will only be applied in certain breakpoint.
- Include `amb-responsive-media()` mixin with the preferred breakpoint.
- Combine more than one breakpoints to achieve responsive design in multiple breakpoints.

```scss
@import '@amar-ui-web/responsive/scss/variables';

.SomeElement {
  // Rest of properties will be applied in all breakpoints unless overriden.

  @include amb-responsive-media('sm') {
    // Apply properties within 'sm' breakpoint here.
  }

  @include amb-responsive-media('lg') {
    // Apply properties within 'lg' breakpoint here.
  }
}
```

## Breakpoint variables

By default, breakpoint variables are put into a variable map called `$amb-responsive-breakpoints`
and each breakpoint consumes a breakpoint variable directly called from `_breakpoints.scss`.

```scss
/* @amar-ui-web/responsive/scss/_breakpoints.scss */
$amb-breakpoint-small: 576px;
$amb-breakpoint-medium: 768px;
$amb-breakpoint-large: 992px;
$amb-breakpoint-xlarge: 1200px;

/* @amar-ui-web/responsive/scss/_variables.scss' */
@import './breakpoints';

// ...

$amb-responsive-breakpoints: () !default;
$amb-responsive-breakpoints: map-merge(
  (
    'xs': 0,
    'sm': $amb-breakpoint-small,
    'md': $amb-breakpoint-medium,
    'lg': $amb-breakpoint-large,
    'xl': $amb-breakpoint-xlarge,
  ),
  $amb-responsive-breakpoints
);
```

You can also change current breakpoint widthds or add new ones.

```scss
// Override current value
$amb-responsive-breakpoints: (
  'sm': <your new value>,
  'md': <your new value>,
);

// Or add a new value on top of the current values
$amb-responsive-breakpoints: (
  '2xl': <new breakpoint>,
  '3xl': <new breakpoint>,
);
```
